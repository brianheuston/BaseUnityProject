This is a template for any Unity game I'd want to create. It features:

- Pause menu
- Title screen
- Blank game scene
- Controller script to initially listen for pause command

TODO:
- Add controller support for menus (Changing to GUI.SelectionGrid)
- Add a button to the game scene that can be tapped/clicked to pause with an option to disable
